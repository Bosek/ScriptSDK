ScriptSDK is my personal vision of handling scripts via API in .NET.
A longer while ago, Maxwell a user from stealth forum, introduced an up-to-date variant of scriptdotnet2.dll inspired by code written by Neo, Orich and me.
The library provide all the functionality imported from stealth to native .NET but never provided managed classes or extensions like making coding for the average user
more easy and more interesting.

After toying with that code for over 1 year i started developming my own SDK, this use the dll of maxwell native and inlined and extend the library by dozen of functions.
The idea was making a generic lightweight framework, allowing the user to design scripts and handle certain situations more easy and allow a faster and more flexible coding.
The object modeling and design is very similar to the patterns of runuo, but under the perspective of the client user instead of the server administrator.
